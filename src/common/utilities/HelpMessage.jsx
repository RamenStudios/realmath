    return  `- The input fields are LaTeX input, and only LaTeX input is accepted. If you are having trouble with manual formatting, each input field allows you to open an on-screen math keyboard!\n
            - Realmath allows you to add up to 3 graphical components. This limit is in place due to URL length restrictions varying from browser-to-browser-- unfortunately, more than 3 components runs the risk of causing the visualizer to malfunction.\n
            - Each graphical component will have its own help message! Be sure to read these before writing your input. If your input is found to be in an incorrect/non-parsable format, Realmath will prompt you to rewrite it.\n
            - The reset button forces a reload of the page, removing all component history.\n
            - Once you are done preparing your components, click the 'VISUALIZE IT!' button. This will provide you with both a URL and link to our 8th Wall visualizer, so you can see your graph come to life! This visualizer only works on mobile devices with a camera and gyroscope (so, most phones!). `
